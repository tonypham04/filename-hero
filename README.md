# Filename Hero
This project seeks to make renaming several files easier by allowing you to specify how you want to rename all files in the current directory (default) or specified directory and then performing the request on all of them in one shot.

## Motivation
When working with files in the command line, spaces are inconvenient because you need to escape them.
Sometimes when I download files online the file names have spaces in them or for some reason have a weird prefix in front of them.
It'd be nice if I could just have a program rename files how I want for me rather than do it manually.
